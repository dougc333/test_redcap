## Framework Version 10

See the [Framework Intro](intro.md) page for more details on framework versions in general.

#### Breaking Changes

- The `$module->removeLogs()` method now returns the number of rows removed.  In previous versions it simply returned `true`.
- If skipping framework versions, do not forget to review/address the breaking changes from all prior framework versions.
