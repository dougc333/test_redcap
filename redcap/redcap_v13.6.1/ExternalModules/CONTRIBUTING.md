## Contributing Additions/Changes to the External Module Framework
[Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) are always welcome.  Email <mark.mcever@vumc.org> to request access to the [External Module Framework GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vanderbilt/redcap-external-modules).  To override the version of this framework bundled with REDCap for development, clone that repo into a directory named **external_modules** under your REDCap web root (e.g., /www/external_modules/).  To add a new method for calling from modules, add it to the [Framework](https://github.com/vanderbilt/redcap-external-modules/blob/testing/classes/framework/Framework.php) class.  Depending on the context, it may make sense to add new methods to one of the helper classes ([Project](https://github.com/vanderbilt/redcap-external-modules/blob/testing/classes/framework/Project.php), [Form](https://github.com/vanderbilt/redcap-external-modules/blob/testing/classes/framework/Form.php), [User](https://github.com/vanderbilt/redcap-external-modules/blob/testing/classes/framework/User.php), etc.) returned by their respective getter methods (e.g. `$module->getProject()`).  Please also include [documentation](docs/methods.md) for your new method in your pull request.  To reference REDCap versions in code or documentation, simply specify "TBD" as a placeholder.  This will be detected and the appropriate version will be inserted when the changes make it into a REDCap release.

If modifying existing functionality, please ensure that the unit tests pass by running `./run-tests.sh` in a unix-like environment (WSL works on Windows).

Here is Mark's personal strategy for contributing back to the framework:
- Prototype any new or modified framework methods inside whatever module for which you need the changes.
- Try to write them so that they would work if copy pasted into the framework
- Once they're mature & well tested, create a pull request.
- Simply leave them duplicated in your module for now.  I typically just add a comment saying `A pull request has been created to merge this method into the module framework.  This method can be removed once the PR is merged and this module's minimum REDCap version is updated accordingly.`
